# IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring on ESP32 

In this project, we will learn how to make IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System Project. We will use the MAX30100/102 Pulse Oximeter sensor to measure the Heart Rate/Pulse(BPM) as well as the Blood Oxygen Level(SpO2).
We will use a DS18B20 Temperature Sensor to measure the temperature of the body.
Similarly Patient needs to be placed in a room with a certain temperature and humidity level so that he doesnâ€™t feel uncomfortable. 
In order to do that we need to monitor the room temperature and humidity as well.
So we will be using DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor.
